#Fading

This c# script helps to fade smoothly between scenes with a black texture. This script was derived from [Brackeys Tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys)

#How to use

Check out the tutorial from [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HwZQt94uHQ)

* Attach the script in any of the active Game Objects in the scene.
* For Fading, call the ```BeginFade()``` function from any other external script, giving the direction of Fading (-1 for fading in, +1 for fading out)
